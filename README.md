# HTTP_AnomalyDetection_Using_AutoEncoders


This GitHub repository contains an implementation of HTTP anomaly detection using autoencoders, aimed at identifying unusual or malicious patterns in HTTP traffic. The project leverages the power of autoencoder neural networks to learn normal behavior patterns from a dataset of benign HTTP traffic. The trained model can then detect anomalies by identifying deviations from the learned normal patterns.

## Features and Highlights:

- **Autoencoder Architecture:** The project implements an autoencoder neural network architecture for unsupervised learning of normal HTTP traffic patterns.
  
- **Dataset Preparation:** Detailed instructions are provided on preparing and formatting the dataset for training the autoencoder. The repository includes a sample dataset for demonstration purposes.

- **Training Process:** The steps for training the autoencoder model are outlined, including hyperparameter configurations and model evaluation metrics.

- **Anomaly Detection:** After training, the model can be used to detect anomalies in new HTTP traffic. The repository includes example scripts and guidelines for implementing the anomaly detection process.

- **Dependencies:** A list of dependencies is provided to ensure a smooth setup and execution of the project. Key dependencies include TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- **Usage:** The README offers clear instructions on how to run the code, train the model, and perform anomaly detection using the provided scripts.

- **Contribution Guidelines:** Contributors are welcome! Guidelines for contributing to the project are outlined, covering areas such as bug reporting, feature requests, and code contributions.
